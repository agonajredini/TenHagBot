# TenHagBot
u/TenHagBot is a reddit bot that corrects popular misspelling of Erik ten Hag.

The bot searches through comments for misspelling of Manchester United's manager name as Ten Haag and posts a reply with the correct spelling (Ten Hag). 
It searches through three main subreddits: r/reddevils, r/soccer, and r/PremierLeague.

**UPDATE: The bot has now unfortunately been banned in all three subreddits.**
